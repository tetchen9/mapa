# Map of the trip

This project documents my trip to Europe in 2023. It's made purely for sentimental and training purposes, it's not production ready code in any case.

The visualisation is done using d3.js
The app draws maps of countries based on a Eurostat dataset in GeoJSON format. Data contains coordinates in 1:10M scale.
The list of cities and routes between cities is loaded in csv format.
Clicking on a town shows the most memorable photo.
Clicking on the route shows transport details.
